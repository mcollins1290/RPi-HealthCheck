In this directory is a .SQL file 'pi_health_check.sql' which can be used to create the initial Raspberry Pi Health Check MariaDB database. All you need to do is to 
install MariaDB and then issue the following command:

mysql -u root -p < ./pi_health_check.sql

You will be prompted for your root password during execution of the script.
Once the script has finished executing you will find that a 'pi_health_check' database now exists within your MariaDB instance.
